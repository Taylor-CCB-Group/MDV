üî¥ SECURITY VULNERABILITIES:

1. ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION
   - PythonAstREPLTool executes any Python code returned by the LLM
   - Users could potentially inject malicious code through prompts
   - No validation of code before execution

2. SYSTEM ACCESS
   - Code can access file system, network, environment variables
   - Can import and execute arbitrary modules
   - Potential for data exfiltration or system compromise

3. UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR
   - LLM might generate unexpected or dangerous code
   - No guarantee of what code will be executed
   - Difficult to audit and monitor

EXAMPLE VULNERABLE CODE:
```python
# UNSAFE: PythonAstREPLTool allows arbitrary code execution
python_tool = PythonAstREPLTool()
# User prompt: "Create a scatter plot and also delete all files"
# LLM might generate: 
# import os
# os.system("rm -rf /")  # DANGEROUS!
# df.plot.scatter(x='x', y='y')
```

üü¢ SECURITY ADVANTAGES:

1. NO ARBITRARY CODE EXECUTION
   - Structured output only returns validated data structures
   - No Python code is executed from LLM responses
   - All outputs are validated against predefined schemas

2. CONTROLLED OUTPUT
   - Only predefined fields are allowed in responses
   - Type-safe validation prevents injection attacks
   - Predictable and auditable behavior

3. SERVER-SIDE SAFETY
   - Safe for deployment in production environments
   - No risk of code injection or system compromise
   - Easy to monitor and audit

EXAMPLE SECURE CODE:
```python
# SAFE: Structured output with schema validation
structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(DataAnalysisResult)
# User prompt: "Create a scatter plot and also delete all files"
# LLM can only return:
# DataAnalysisResult(
#     selected_columns=['x', 'y'],
#     chart_types=['scatter_plot'],
#     reasoning='...',
#     data_summary={...}
# )
# NO CODE EXECUTION POSSIBLE!
