    A protocol for server extensions that can be used with MDV projects.

    We might use this for blocks of other functionality that aren't totally core mdv functionality,
    integrating other services/libraries/functionality.
    We might also re-arrange so that some things like the add_anndata routes are moved into an extension.

    Maybe rather than pass a Flask app to `server.py`, we pass something representing MDV app configuration,
    including a Flask app, these extensions, auth provider etc...
    Flask becomes an implementation detail that we abstract away somewhat.
