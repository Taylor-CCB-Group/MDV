# Build the frontend with npm
# warning - we had an obscure npm error with cross-env not found, and it seems like using an earlier nodejs version fixed it
# for some reason node_modules/.bin wasn't populated after `RUN npm install` - but manually running it in the container worked
# not sure if there's a way of pinning a more specific build of the base image. May want to see if we can reproduce this issue outside of docker.

# Configure poetry for the pn user - let it create virtual environments for isolation
# 
# VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS IN DOCKER CONSIDERATIONS:
# 
# PROS of using virtual environments (current approach):
# - Security: poetry install runs in isolated environment, can't affect system packages
# - Permission isolation: avoids conflicts with system-installed packages like certifi
# - Standard practice: how poetry is intended to be used
# - Safer with untrusted code: LLM-generated code runs in more isolated environment
# 
# CONS of using virtual environments:
# - Less convenient for terminal use: need to run `poetry shell` or `poetry run` for commands
# - Seems redundant: container already provides isolation from host system
# - Extra layer: adds complexity when debugging dependency issues
# - Performance: slight overhead from virtual environment activation
# 
# PROS of disabling virtual environments (previous approach):
# - Convenience: can run python/pip commands directly in terminal without activation
# - Simpler: no need to remember to use `poetry run` or `poetry shell`
# - Direct access: easier to inspect installed packages and run ad-hoc scripts
# 
# CONS of disabling virtual environments:
# - Permission conflicts: user can't modify system packages (the current issue)
# - Security risk: poetry install can affect system Python environment
# - Mixing concerns: system packages and project packages in same namespace
# 
# DECISION: Using virtual environments for security and permission isolation,
# despite the convenience tradeoff. For terminal use inside container:
# - Use `poetry shell` to activate the environment
# - Or prefix commands with `poetry run`
# - Or add alias in bashrc: alias python='poetry run python'
