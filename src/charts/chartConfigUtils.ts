/**
 * This is a utility module for handling the serialisation and deserialisation of chart configurations.
 * 
 * In particular, with the introduction of dynamic column queries, we need to be able to represent these.
 * There are essentially three lifecycle stages for something that specifies a column in a chart configuration:
 * - A `string` representing a concrete column name (which may have specialÂ formatting to indicate it's a linked column)
 * - A live object representing a query that will return observable column (e.g. RowsAsColsQuery)
 * - A serialised object representing the query that can be stored in a JSON object.
 * 
 * A lot of existing charts expect strings, and we have mechanisms for instrumenting these to accept a query object - 
 * but this requires manual adaptation of the code in a way that can be error-prone.
 * 
 * It is hoped that in most cases newer charts based on React will be able to handle the query objects directly,
 * as long as it is clear at what point the configuration object is serialised and deserialised, they should be able
 * to use simple hooks, which will transparently return appropriate column objects (as in, with actual column data)
 * without being too concerned about the serialisation format etc.
 * 
 * ! as well as RowsAsColsQuery, I may implement some synthetic mock column types that can be used for testing.
 * ^^ perhaps we could try to design the error-reporting mechanism to describe something that we could reproduce without the original data???
